- A new folder is created on your Desktop with a timestamped name, e.g., `COLLECTED_FILES_2025-07-15_15-30-00`  
- Inside the folder, files are organized into subfolders named `<Category>_<YYYY-MM-DD>`, based on file modification date  
- Duplicate files with identical content are renamed with a `_dup` suffix (e.g., `document_dup.pdf`)  
- A `log.txt` file is created in the root output folder (except in dry run mode)  
  - Contains detailed copy/rename/duplicate actions and a summary

- Selecting exactly which file types to collect  
- Sorting files by category and modification date  
- Keeping all unique files intact and renaming duplicates  
- Previewing the process before actual copying with dry run mode

## üóíÔ∏è Notes

- The source files and folders are never deleted or modified  
- Sorting is based solely on file modification timestamps  
- The GUI provides real-time progress and status messages
